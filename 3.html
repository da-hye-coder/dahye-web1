  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
  just-in-time compiled, object-oriented programming language that conforms
  to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax,
  dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
  of the World Wide Web.</p>
  <p>[11] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
  an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,
  [12] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
